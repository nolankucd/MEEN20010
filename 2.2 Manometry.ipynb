    "Consider the section of pipe shown below. A liquid flows along the length of the pipe (we can assume it is much longer than shown and the flow moves entirely parallel to the pipe) and at some point along its length a hole is drilled and a small open tube is inserted normal to the upper surface. This arrangement is called a **piezometer tube**.\n",

    "The answer is that for some constant velocity in the main pipe is that the flow will rise up the perpendicular tube some finite $h$ and stop once it's reached an equilibrium.\n",
    "If we change the velocity in the pipe the level $h$ will change accordingly. Why? In order to increase the velocity in the pipe we have too apply more pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are applying a positive gauge pressure at the pipe inlet and then let the pipe exit to the atmosphere (zero gauge pressure) then there will be a *pressure gradient* along the length of the pipe and the liquid will flow from high to low pressure — at a **constant velocity** (it's a little more complicated than that but more on that later). This result is that the hydrostatic pressure is constant perpendicular to the direction of flow (assuming a sufficiently small diameter). In fact if we place a series of these *'piezometer tubes'* along the length of the pipe we could visualise the pressure gradient along the pipe.\n",
