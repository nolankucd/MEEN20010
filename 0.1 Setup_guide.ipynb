I'll use PowerShell here because it is somewhat closer to the _UNIX_ environment I prefer. This type of tool is often called variously, a command line interface, the terminal or a shell.\n",
    "They allow you to control a computer by typing a wide range of text commands, which may seem archaic when you've got a UI you can easily click your way around, but is in fact an extremely efficient and powerful way you to run complex and automated tasks that would take much longer by clicking with a mouse. It also uses less resources leaving more compute power for actual work instead of rendering fancy transparent windows. All of the world's supercomputers operate in this manner for these reasons. As engineers it is good to be exposed to such tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a snapshot of a new PowerShell window. At the top you can see some Microsoft legal text and a link to some new tool of theirs. \n",

    "```PS C:\\Users\\Kevin```\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells me that the current directory is `C:\\Users\\Kevin` which is my User folder of the Windows installation on my PC. This called a prompt because this is where we are prompted to enter commands. Entering the `dir` command for example will result in the contents of this folder (`C:\\Users\\Kevin`) being listed on the screen. It is important to understand that any actions performed in this windows can affect the files in the current directory (directory is just another word for folder). It is just another way of using your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "So for example if I could change directory to a folder in Documents using the `cd` command \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PS C:\\Users\\Kevin> cd C:\\Users\\Kevin\\Documents\\\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the command is `cd` followed by a space followed by a file path `C:\\Users\\Kevin\\Documents\\`. This the typical way things are done. Sometimes you can specify options to modify how the command behaves.\n",
    "As above`dir` will list the contents of the folder. There are many commands some of which are dangerous. The command `del` will permanently delete any file you tell it. It will not be placed in the Recycle Bin, it will be simply be deleted without any ability to recover it. So don't delete your homework!\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that your somewhat familiar with the command line interface go ahead and type `python` at the prompt.\n",
